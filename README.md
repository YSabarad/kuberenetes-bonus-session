# Kubernetes Bonus Session
A session created for RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source) Summer 2021. Details Kubernetes, Kubeflow Pipelines, and Kubernetes in Docker. Created by Yash Sabarad. 

Kubernetes
------------------------
An open source platform that acts as the conductor for a containerized deployment. It manages the containers to optimize the deployment and create a better experience for user and developer.

Kubeflow Pipelines
------------------------
Among other things, an application that provides a user interface to visualize and manipulate machine learning workflows. 

Kubernetes in Docker
------------------------
The long form for KiND. Allows the manager to be used on local containers, eliminating the need for a cloud service to host a deployment (given that the local machine is capable of handling the deployment).
