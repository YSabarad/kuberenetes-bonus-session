# Kubernetes Bonus Session
A session created for RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source) Summer 2021. Details Kubernetes, Kubeflow Pipelines, and Kubernetes in Docker. Created by Yash Sabarad. 

Kubernetes
------------------------
An open source platform that acts as the conductor for a containerized deployment. It manages the containers to optimize the deployment and create a better experience for user and developer.

Kubeflow Pipelines
------------------------
Among other things, an application that provides a user interface to visualize and manipulate machine learning workflows. 

Kubernetes in Docker
------------------------
The long form for KiND. Allows the manager to be used on local containers, eliminating the need for a cloud service to host a deployment (given that the local machine is capable of handling the deployment). 

# Quick Note
The slide that says "Deep Dive" is meant to be a time where the presenter gives a drawn demonstration of how Kubernetes and Docker work. I imagine it would look similiar to what this man does: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfRWP60qxPM&ab_channel=CalebCurry

The slide that says "Hello World" is meant to serve as a live example of running a KIND demo. It doesn't have to be Hello World - consider using the default kind image and using the command line to show things like creation, interatction, deletion: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/
